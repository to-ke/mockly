# Quick Start - Code Quality Evaluation

## What Was Implemented

Claude AI now evaluates candidate code submissions with detailed ratings on:
- **Code Cleanliness** (1-5): Readability, naming, structure, best practices
- **Communication** (1-5): Placeholder at 3 for now
- **Efficiency** (1-5): Time/space complexity, optimization, algorithm choice

## How It Works

1. **User writes code** in Monaco editor during interview
2. **User clicks "End Interview"** button
3. **System automatically**:
   - Captures code from editor
   - Sends to Claude with question context
   - Gets detailed evaluation and ratings
4. **User sees** star ratings and feedback on the feedback screen

## Testing the Implementation

### Option 1: Using the Test Script
```bash
# Start backend
cd mockly-backend
python -m app.main

# In another terminal, run test
python test_code_evaluation.py
```

### Option 2: Full Application Test
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd mockly-backend
python -m app.main

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd mockly-frontend
npm run dev

# Then in browser:
# 1. Go to http://localhost:5173
# 2. Start an interview
# 3. Write some code
# 4. Click "End Interview"
# 5. See your code evaluation!
```

## What Changed

### Backend
- `prompts.py`: New `build_code_evaluation_prompt()` with evaluation criteria
- `routes_feedback.py`: Now accepts code and calls Claude for evaluation

### Frontend
- `api.ts`: Updated to send code with feedback request
- `App.tsx`: Captures code from editor when ending interview

## Key Features

✅ **Real code analysis** - Claude sees actual code from Monaco editor
✅ **Context-aware** - Includes question details for better evaluation
✅ **Detailed feedback** - Specific, actionable comments with markdown formatting
✅ **Rich text display** - Category headings, bold emphasis, code highlighting
✅ **Rating scale** - 1-5 with clear criteria
✅ **Language agnostic** - Works with any programming language
✅ **Communication placeholder** - Set to 3, ready for future voice analysis

## Example Evaluation Criteria

### Code Cleanliness (What Claude Checks)
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Proper function naming conventions
- Good code organization
- Consistent formatting
- Appropriate comments

### Efficiency (What Claude Checks)
- Optimal time complexity
- Good space complexity
- Right data structures
- Edge case handling
- Performance considerations

## Files You Can Review

- `CODE_EVALUATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full technical documentation
- `EVALUATION_EXAMPLE.md` - Sample evaluations with different code quality
- `test_code_evaluation.py` - Test script to verify it works

## Notes

- Communication score is intentionally placeholder (3) until voice analysis is added
- Make sure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in your environment
- Backend must be running for evaluation to work
- Frontend automatically sends code when interview ends
