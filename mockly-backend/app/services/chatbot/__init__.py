"""Chatbot package exports.

This package contains a thin Claude client, prompt builders, a TTS
sanitizer/adapter and a small Agent fa√ßade to be used by FastAPI
endpoints. It is intentionally lightweight so the existing endpoints
in `workflow/api.py` can be incrementally refactored to import from
here.
